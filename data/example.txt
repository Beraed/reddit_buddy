**I adopted Francis (14yrs) last year and I've posted a few times about our journey together. I bought a cart for him last week so he could feel the wind on his face and two fellow Redditors, Ryan and Jill (all the way from California!) sent him the coolest umbrella to pimp up his ride! TY ❤️❤️❤️❤️**
